The current version deployed in the MVP is for testing only and allows unlimited supply minting. This was intentional for fast prototyping of the scoring ‚Üí token emission mechanism.

We will gradually move towards the final production-ready capped token contract.


‚úÖ v0.1 ‚Äì MVP (Testing Phase)

Unlimited Supply: Tokens are minted every time a score is submitted.

Purpose: Quickly validate MVP logic:

Wallet registration

Score submission

Token emission mechanism

Not for mainnet: This version is unsafe for production since it allows infinite inflation.

üöß v0.2 ‚Äì Cap-Enforced Token (Final Design)

Max Supply: xxxxx TREEV tokens .

Minting Rules:

Tokens can only be minted via score submission.

Enforced cap ensures total supply never exceeds max.

Governance Hooks: Only the owner (TreeView backend/DAO later) can submit scores.

üõ†Ô∏è v0.3 ‚Äì DAO-Ready Upgrade

Ownership Transfer: Move from single owner to DAO-controlled multi-sig or governance contract.

Dynamic Conversion Rate: POINTS_PER_TOKEN adjustable via governance proposal.

Additional Features:

Vesting for contributors/investors.

Pausable contract (already integrated).

Burnable tokens.
