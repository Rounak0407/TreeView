TreeView – Decentralized 4D Mapping Network

TreeView is building the first decentralized 4D mapping network powered by community-contributed multimodal data and AI. Our mission is to create a permissionless, continuously updated, and semantically rich map of the world — owned by the people who build it.

🚨 Problem

Today's digital maps are:

❌ Outdated or low-resolution

❌ Closed and centralized

❌ Lacking semantic understanding (objects, terrain, context)

❌ Not designed for autonomous systems, AR/VR, or Earth monitoring

✅ Solution

TreeView is a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) where:

📱 Contributors upload videos & sensor data from mobile devices, dashcams, drones, etc.

🧠 Our on-device + cloud AI pipeline fuses video, LiDAR, GPS, depth, segmentation, and object detection into high-fidelity 3D/4D maps.

🛰️ We are launching the first community-owned satellite initiative, governed and funded via an NFT-DAO, to capture global high-altitude data.

🌳 Semantic metadata enables Earth environment management (forest health, urban planning, disaster detection, etc.)

💰 Contributors earn tokens for their data, validators earn for verifying, and apps build on top of the open mapping layer.

🧠 Core Tech
